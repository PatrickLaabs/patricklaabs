### Hello! I'm Patrick.

:v: Go enthusiast
:muscle: DevOps lover

Currently I am building my Jenkins pipeline with some GitHub Actions & Workflows to have a full ci/cd pipeline up and running for my golang application.
The Golang Application is not ready yet and currently I am only getting the tests running.

The other project I am working on is a go application, that catches inputs from the terminal and saves it to a file. The hard part (for me at least) is to safe new inputs into a new line automaticly
