### Hello! I'm Patrick.

:v: Go enthusiast

:muscle: DevOps lover

---I build a pipeline for/in GitHub Actions for golang projects. The Goal is to have a clean and easy to set up pipeline

for almost every golang project - so no more rebuilding the pipe for every project.

Well, lets see if this works out as intended :P At least its empowered by goreleaser :heart:[golang-pipeline](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs/golang-pipeline)---Currently I am building my Jenkins pipeline with some GitHub Actions & Workflows to have a full ci/cdpipeline up and running for my golang application.
The Golang Application is not ready yet and currentlyI am only getting the tests running.

The other project I am working on is a go application, that catchesinputs from the terminal and saves it to a file. The hard part (for me at least) is to safe new inputs into a newline automaticly
