### Hello! I'm Patrick.

:v: Go enthusiast

:muscle: DevOps lover

I build a pipeline for/in GitHub Actions for golang projects.
 The Goal is to have a clean and easy to set up pipelinefor almost every golang project
so no more rebuilding the pipe for every project.

Well, lets see if this works out as intended. At least its empowered by goreleaser :heart:
