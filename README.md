### Hello! I'm Patrick.

Go enthusiast and just getting started on my journey to DevOps :) 

Currently I am building my Jenkins pipeline with some GitHub Actions & Workflows to have a full ci/cd pipeline up and running for my golang application.
The Golang Application is not ready yet and currently I am only getting the tests running.
Next thing that I want to have running is Goreleaser... but this may take some time :D
